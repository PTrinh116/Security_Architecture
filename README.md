## Project Objectives

1. **Analysis of Weaknesses in the Current Network Model**  
   - Identify and analyze **security risks** associated with the current network infrastructure.

2. **Data Loss Risks Analysis**  
   - Examine risks related to data loss from two primary sources:  
     - **Attackers**: Identify major risks.  
     - **Employees**: Identify major risks.  
   - Include methodologies and tools used for the assessment.  
   - Provide a **Risk Score Table** for the current system.

3. **Redesign of a Secure Network System**  
   - Propose a new network design with a focus on **data loss prevention**:  
     - **Overall System Model**: Comprehensive overview diagram.  
     - **Detailed Models**: Specific designs for key areas such as Web Security, Email Security, IDS/IPS Security, etc.  
   - Provide detailed explanations for each solution, with justification per solution.  
   - Include a **Risk Score Table** for the new system.

4. **Policy Development**  
   - Define **policies** to complement the technologies implemented in the redesigned system, aiming to minimize data loss risks.
